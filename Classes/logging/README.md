# Logging

## Python logging

1. Use test_log.py and model.py to test Python logging

## AWS logs

In AWS Lambda, the logs generated by your Lambda functions are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

CloudWatch Logs is a fully managed service provided by AWS that allows you to collect, monitor, and store logs from various AWS services, including Lambda.

1. Run functs_available.py to see all available lambda functions and then run display_logs.py with the lambda function name that you want to see the logs

## Write Logs to S3

Some applications generate huge log loads, which makes local storage unfeasible. Furthermore, it is in the interest of companies that the logs are stored centrally, facilitating their use to generate improvements.

Therefore, it is interesting to store logs in AWS S3 storage. To do this, we will create a an in-memory stream for storing log data and write it to S3.

1. Create the bucket with ["create_bucket.py"](./create_bucket.py)

2. Simulate logs with ["simulate_logs_s3.py](./simulate_logs_s3.py)

3. Check logs with ["check_logs_s3.py"](./check_logs_s3.py)
